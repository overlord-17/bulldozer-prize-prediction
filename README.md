# bulldozer-prize-prediction
## This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.
> The data is downloaded from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data
> The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.
